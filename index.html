                <h3>Co-founder of Apple Computer</h3>

                <br>
                <p>
                <div id="ot"> Steve Jobs, in full Steven Paul Jobs, (born February 24, 1955, San Francisco, California,
                    U.S.—died
                    October 5, 2011, Palo Alto, California), cofounder of Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and a
                    charismatic pioneer of the personal computer era. </div>
                <br>

                <br>
                <strong>Jobs</strong> was raised by adoptive
                parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now
                known as
                Silicon Valley. Though he was interested in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He
                dropped out of Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, took a job at Atari Corporation as a video
                game designer in early 1974, and saved enough money for a pilgrimage to India to experience
                Buddhism.
                <br>

                Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a
                former high school friend who was working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told
                Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go
                into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s
                design in 1976.<div style="color: rgb(163, 152, 109);"> The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was
                    built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and
                    Wozniak’s programmable calculator. </div> <br>
                Jobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would
                appeal to a broad audience, at least if it did not appear to belong in a junior high school
                science fair. With Jobs’s encouragement, Wozniak designed an improved model, the Apple II,
                complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded plastic case
                manufactured to enclose the unit.
                <br>
                <br>
                Though Jobs had long, unkempt hair and eschewed business garb, he managed to obtain
                financing, distribution, and publicity for the company, Apple Computer, incorporated in
                1977—the same year that the Apple II was completed. The machine was an immediate success,
                becoming synonymous with the boom in personal computers. In 1981 the company had a
                record-setting public stock offering, and in 1983 it made the quickest entrance (to that
                time) into the Fortune 500 list of America’s top companies. In 1983 the company recruited
                PepsiCo, Inc., president John Sculley to be its chief executive officer (CEO) and,
                implicitly, Jobs’s mentor in the fine points of running a large corporation. Jobs had
                convinced Sculley to accept the position by challenging him: <strong>“Do you want to sell
                    sugar
                    water for the rest of your life?”</strong> The line was shrewdly effective, but it also
                revealed
                Jobs’s own near-messianic belief in the computer revolution.
